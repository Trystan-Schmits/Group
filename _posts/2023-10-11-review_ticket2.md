## Sprite Animation Code Explanation
Animation Code: [Animation](http://127.0.0.1:4200/Group//c4.1/2023/10/04/Animation-with-Sprites.html)
-This code sets up a basic interactive 2D game using HTML, Canvas and JavaScript. It includes buttons to start, stop, and reset the animation, as well as an input field to set the frames per second (fps). The game involves a character sprite that can be controlled using arrow keys. Various objects such as a background, dresser, slime, and eyes are displayed on the canvas. The game loop continuously updates the frame, handles player input, and animates the character and other objects based on their positions and interactions.
