```javascript
function checkForOverlap(object1,object2){
    var pos1 = object1.ReturnPosition().slice();
    var scale1 = object1.ReturnScale().slice();   
    var xRange1 = [pos1[0],pos1[0]+scale1[0]];
    var yRange1 = [pos1[1],pos1[1]+scale1[1]];
â€‹
    var pos2 = object2.ReturnPosition().slice();
    var scale2 = object2.ReturnScale().slice();   
    var xRange2 = [pos2[0],pos2[0]+scale2[0]];
    var yRange2 = [pos2[1],pos2[1]+scale2[1]];
    
    if (xRange1[0]>=xRange2[0]){
        if (xRange1[0]<=xRange2[1]){
            if (yRange1[0]>=yRange2[0]){
                if (yRange1[0]<=yRange2[1]){
                    return true;
                }
            }
            if (yRange1[1]>=yRange2[0]){
                if (yRange1[1]<=yRange2[1]){
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    if (xRange1[1]>=xRange2[0]){
        if (xRange1[1]<=xRange2[1]){
            if (yRange1[0]>=yRange2[0]){
                if (yRange1[0]<=yRange2[1]){
                    return true;
                }
            }
            if (yRange1[1]>=yRange2[0]){
                if (yRange1[1]<=yRange2[1]){
                    return true;
                }
            }

}
```



## Code Explanation
1. The checkForOverlap function takes two objects as input, object1 and object2.
2. For each object, it gets the position using the functions ReturnPosition and ReturnScale and keeps them in variables pos1, scale1, pos2, and scale2.
3. It calculates the x and y ranges for both objects by adding the position and scale values:
-For object1, xRange1 represents the range of x-coordinates, and yRange1 represents the range of y-coordinates.
-For object2, xRange2 and yRange2 are calculated similarly.
4. The function then checks if the x-coordinate ranges and y-coordinate ranges of the two objects overlap using if statements. If any of the conditions are met, it shows true, which means that there is a collision between the objects.
 5. If there is no overlap between two objects, the function shows as false.  

### Collision implementation
 ```Javascript
   if (checkForOverlap(myCharacterObject, doorObject)) {
        console.log("Now press the P key");
    }
```

## Code Explanation
This code takes the two objects (character and door) from [The original code](http://127.0.0.1:4200/Group//c4.1/2023/10/19/Gametest2.html) (Ctrl+Shift+I -> console), that were defined earlier.

1. Takes the collision code (defined as checkForOverlap) and then the two objects in a "If" statement; so IF the two objects collide, something would happen.
2. Now when the checkForOverlap sees the two objects of the Character and Object collide, (Using the [Collision Code](http://127.0.0.1:4200/Group//c4.1/2023/10/19/OverLap1.html)) it pastes the message "Now Press the P key" in the console. as seen in the following:
