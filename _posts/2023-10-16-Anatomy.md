# Introduction
In our effort to learn, and do classwork, we as a team strived to make a basic game in js. While creating a project decideding and splitting work between each person is necesary. Each person had an important part in making the game and did different parts of the project.

[Trystan](/Group/projectSummary/Trystan) -Created most of the basic classes used within the game <br>
[Spencer](/Group/projectSummary/Spencer) -Designed most of the story and did some coding, designed the main menu <br>
[Sean](/Group/projectSummary/Sean) -Created a lot of the art, and did some coding <br>
[Zafeer](/Group/Documentation/Zafeer) -Kept track of progress and drew a lot of art within the game, also did some coding

This class Diagram shows how different parts of the game work together.
- At the most basic level you the **object class**
    - this class is what draws images to different places on the screen
- Next major level you have the **subDisplay class** 
    - this class holds a group of objects, and tells them when (and if wanted where) to draw the objects to the screen
    - this classes draw function doesn't have to be used for objects to be drawn, you can still draw objects directly to the class' canvas, this is where the light function can be used.
- Finally at the highest level you have the **Display class**
    - this class is mainly for switching between what display you want to draw to the screen. For example you could have 2 rooms and switch between them depending on you actions.
